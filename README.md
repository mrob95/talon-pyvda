# talon-pyvda
Talon scripts for manipulating virtual desktops on Windows 10 using the [pyvda package](https://github.com/mrob95/pyvda). This will need to be installed by executing:
```
bin/pip.bat install pyvda
```
from a shell inside the talon home directory (`AppData/Roaming/talon`).

Once pyvda is installed and available within talon, the commands in this repository can be added by running:
```
cd user
git submodule add https://github.com/mrob95/talon-pyvda.git
```
